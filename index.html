<h3> We loved it </h3>
<p>"Excellent hotel!! Walking distance to Boudha stupa and hotel offers shuttle rides to main tourist districts in Kathmandu city like Thamel and Durbar Square. The rooms are very clean and the staff top-notched -- they even went out of their way to offer us travelling tips. Will return again!"</p>

<h3> Comfortable Living </h3>
<p>"This is truly luxurious accommodation to hide away after the hustle and bustle of Khatmandu. The rooms are spacious and the interior design reflects the cultural beauty of the country. Staff are extremely helpful. The food is top-notch and the nightly entertainment in the courtyard is an added bonus. The spa is also a welcome facility on site."</p>
